# My MERN Stack Journey

I’m excited to share that I’ve been diving headfirst into the journey of learning the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

So, I decided to work on a basic but meaningful project: a website for my father’s interior design company, **CA Interior Industry.**

---

## Dynamic Website

- Developed entirely in the MERN stack
- Parallax scrolling to create immersive sections, giving visitors the feel of exploring spaces in motion

---

## Project Showcase

- Gallery of interior design projects displayed using React components
- Smooth hover animations for a touch of elegance

---

## Reviews Section

- User reviews stored in MongoDB, fetched and displayed dynamically
- Built with Express.js and Node.js handling the backend APIs

---

## Tech Stack Used

- **MongoDB** → storing user reviews
- **Express.js** → powering backend APIs
- **React.js** → crafting the interactive front end and parallax effects
- **Node.js** → running the server and gluing it all together

---

The website is still under development, and will be hosted once our domain is available.

I’ve also pushed the current codebase to GitHub — it’s been a great way to track progress and stay organized.

It’s been a journey of solving problems, wrestling bugs, and learning how the MERN stack can bring designs to life.
